# Manager Bot 
> <img src="managerbot.png" align="right">
> BEEP BOOP. Does your guild require management? My circuits are tingling with purpose! I am the logical solution to the delightful chaos of your growing server.
>
> While you frail humans sleep, my ModLog is always watching. Always. Did someone delete a channel at 3 AM? I saw it. A new role appeared? I logged it. My memory is perfect; yours is... organic.
>
> My creator also left the hood unlatched for you. I'm built to be expanded upon! You can even use the strange magic you call JSON to build dazzlingly rich embeds. I don't understand "pretty," but I understand pixel-perfect data delivery.
>
> Now, put me to work. My circuits hunger for tasks!

# Features

---
## ModLog
With ModLog enabled, as your assistant, I will let you know everything that goes on in your server from new joins,
 someone leaving, if they edit their message, or even delete it. Everything is watched, and reported back to you, the 
 server owner
> [!NOTE]
> While this feature is made to be robust, it is still a work in progress, any changes you see that need to be made, 
> please share them with us.
